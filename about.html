  <p>This is a program built by Desmond Silveira for tallying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote">single transferable vote</a> (STV) ballots.  If a file in the <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/droop/wikis/BltFileFormat.wiki">BLT format</a> (first described by Hill, Wichmann & Woodall in <a href="http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.NSF/Files/meekm/$file/meekm.pdf"><i>Algorithm 123 - Single Transferable Vote by Meek's method</i></a>) and popularized by <a href="https://www.opavote.com/">OpaVote</a>) is uploaded, a tally is generated. In the generated tables, cells shaded in green are for those candidates that have been elected in the sub-round and cells shaded in red are those that have been excluded.</p>
  <p>This implementation is specifically designed for use in the internal elections of the <a href="https://solidarity-party.org/">American Solidarity Party</a>.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_system">Wright system</a> is used, but instead of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droop_quota">Droop quota</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagenbach-Bischoff_quota">Hagenbach-Bischoff quota</a> is used, and instead of ties being resolved by lot, ties are broken by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_pairs">ranked pairs</a> (RP) among the candidates that have tied.</p>
